# def some_method(block)
#   block_given?
# end

# bloc = proc { puts "hi" }

# p some_method("jesse", &bloc)

# The above code will output false because we are not  passing in a block, but a proc object.
#  If we prepend a unary ampersand  symbol `&` before the passed in argument on `line 393` 
#  and before the parameter variable `block` on `line 387` of `some_method` then the output will be `true`.


# def some()
#   yield
# end

# bloc = proc { p "hi" } # do not alter

# some(&bloc)

# why do we get localerror 
# how do we fix it (2 ways)


# we get a localjump error because we are yielding to a block (implicit) but we have no passed in an implciit block to the method

# to fix this, we can prepend the argument we pass into the some method inovcation with a unary &, which will convert the bloc Proc object 
# into a block and also palce unary & before the some method defintion arghument, which will convert the passed in block to a proc object, although we will not do anything with that proc object within the method 


# Questions: 

# how to specifically talk about closures and binding? 
  # - is there a closure without a binding? as in, are blocks/procs/lanmdas closures be default?
  # - is there a binding with no artifacts to bind to?

# what is the difference between a closure and a method? 

# A closure can be thought of as a method defined without an explicit name that can be passed around and executed within a program. 
  # how is this true for a proc that is defined with a local variable name? 
  # how is a block a chunk of code we can save and pass around for later? 

# unary & in method invocation is proc to block 
  # if it's not a proc, ruby will try to convert it to a proc? 
  # if that's true, why can we not deffine a custom to_proc method that works for strings for example?





# synbol to proc 
# def example(str)
#   puts yield(str)
# end 

# num = '1'
# example(num, &:to_i)
# example(num) { |x| x.to_i }


# to proc works for the following classes: 
# Symbol#to_proc
# Method#to_proc
# Hash#to_proc





# What are two use cases for blocks?


# sandwich code 


# def passing_time
#   start_time = Time.now
#   yield if block_given?
#   end_time = Time.now

#   puts "Wow! That only took #{end_time - start_time} seconds to complete."
# end

# passing_time { sleep(2) }



# p [1, 2, 3].inject { |acc, num| acc + num } 
# p [1,2,3].inject(10, :+)



# # Whatâ€™s the arity of a method, with respect to non-block vs block arguments?

# Passing the incorrect number of non-block arguments raises an `ArgumentError` exception (due to **strict arity**). A passed block will always be accepted, but not necessarily used.

# Blocks have lenient arity, so any number of arguments can be passed to them. It ignores extra arguments and uses `nil` for omitted arguments.
